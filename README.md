This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on coursera.org. All code is written in Octave/MATLAB. 

Course material:
- **Learning Algorithms (Supervised and Unsupervised)**: linear and logistic regression, neural networks, SVMs, k-means, anomaly detection, PCA
- **General ML Principles**: bias and variance, error analysis, best practices for evaluating learning algorithms
- **Other**: recommender systems and collaborative filtering, large scale machine learning, applications to Photo OCR
